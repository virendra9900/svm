        "### Question 1: What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and how does it work?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks, but it can also be used for regression. It is especially powerful for binary classification problems, where the goal is to separate data points into two categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How SVM Works:**  \n",
        "SVM works by finding the best decision boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates the data into different classes. This hyperplane is chosen in such a way that the margin between the classes is as large as possible. The margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. These closest points are called support vectors, and they play a key role in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hyperplane:**  \n",
        "  A line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a higher-dimensional surface that divides the dataset into different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Margin:**  \n",
        "  The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. A larger margin usually leads to better generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Support Vectors:**  \n",
        "  These are the data points closest to the hyperplane. They are \"supporting\" the hyperplane and directly affect its position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Linear vs. Non-linear Separation:**  \n",
        "  - If data is linearly separable, SVM finds a straight line (or plane) to divide the classes.  \n",
        "  - If data is not linearly separable, SVM uses a technique called the **kernel trick** to project the data into a higher dimension where it becomes separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Kernel Trick:**  \n",
        "  A mathematical function used to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space. This makes it possible to separate non-linear data using a linear boundary in that space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regularization (Soft Margin):**  \n",
        "  SVM can allow some misclassifications to prevent overfitting. This is called using a soft margin, which gives the model flexibility when dealing with noisy or overlapping data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of SVM:**\n",
        "- Works well for high-dimensional data.\n",
        "- Effective even when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.\n",
        "- Can handle non-linear data using kernels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages of SVM:**\n",
        "- Training can be slow for very large datasets.\n",
        "- Performance depends heavily on the choice of kernel and its parameters.\n",
        "- Not suitable for datasets with a lot of noise and overlapping classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-life Example:**  \n",
        "Suppose we are building an email spam detector. An SVM can learn to classify emails as spam or not spam by analyzing the words in the emails and learning the optimal decision boundary that separates spam from legitimate messages.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Support Vector Machine (SVM), the goal is to find the best boundary (called a hyperplane) that separates the data into classes. Depending on how strictly the model separates the classes, there are two types of margins: Hard Margin and Soft Margin.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Hard Margin SVM\n",
        "A Hard Margin SVM is the strictest version of SVM. It tries to separate the data with no errors at all.\n",

        "**Characteristics:**\n",
        "- Assumes the data is perfectly linearly separable.\n",
        "- No data points are allowed to lie within the margin or on the wrong side of the boundary.\n",

        "- Simple and works well for clean, noise-free data.\n",

        "- Introduces flexibility by allowing some points to be within the margin or misclassified.\n",
        "- Controlled by parameter **C**:\n",

        "  - A small C = more tolerance, allows a wider margin.\n",

        "- Works better on real-world datasets with noise and overlapping classes.\n",
        "- Helps prevent overfitting.\n",
